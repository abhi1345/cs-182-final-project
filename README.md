CS 182 Vision Project - Generalizable Classifiers
This is some sample code for the CS 182/282 Computer Vision project (Tensorflow 2). It has the following files:

Our code is split up into .py files and .ipynb files.

To train the model, train_sample.py is used. In order to train with data that includes the fooled and cropped data, first those
data folder need to be generated. utils/format.py is used to format the val set into a similar format to the
train set so that in cane be used in the generators.

The fooled data is generated using fooled_data.py, the paths need to be set appropriately. The pretrained model can be
any pretrained model.
The cropped data is generated by the Bounding Box.ipynb. 

The shutil.copytree() command is used to create a bigger data folder that includes the original images, the cropped images,
and the fooled images. 

The utils folder includes some files that were used to make tracking our various models.
